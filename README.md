# Web-Scraping
The repository 'Web-Scraping' contains a collection of Python scripts and examples that demonstrate how to perform web scraping using Selenium. The scripts can be used to automate data extraction from websites, interact with web elements like forms and buttons, and collect information for data analysis and research purposes.
