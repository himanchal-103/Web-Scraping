# Web-Scraping
The repository 'Web-Scraping' contains a collection of Python scripts and examples demonstrating how to perform web scraping using Selenium. The scripts can automate data extraction from websites, interact with web elements like forms and buttons, and collect information for data analysis and research purposes.

This is an automation script designed to interact with Instagram using Selenium for browser automation.
